## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

### What I learned


This project helped me get more familiar with flexbox and building responsive layouts. It was great practice for:

- Using flexbox to center items on the page.
- Implementing responsive design with media queries to adjust the cardâ€™s size on smaller screens.
- Working with custom fonts and CSS units to maintain consistent spacing and sizing.

Here's an example of how I centered the `.card` using flexbox:

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to:

- Explore more CSS features like grid for more complex layouts.
- Improve my knowledge of accessibility, especially focusing on screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Dive deeper into responsive design and creating more complex layouts for various devices.
